NOTES:
- All "end" scenes (5a, 6b_stay, 6b_switch, 6b_third) should include a modern U.S. electoral map showing the heavily Republican South and Democratic Northeast as a visual reminder of the long-term realignment
- Images should evoke 1960s aesthetic for scenes 1-5b
- Consider using historical photographs or historically-accurate illustrations
- The modern electoral maps in end scenes provide visual closure showing the result of the realignment
